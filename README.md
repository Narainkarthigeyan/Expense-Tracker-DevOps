⚙️ DevOps Workflow
Developer → GitHub → GitHub Actions → Maven Build → Docker Build → Jenkins → Docker Compose → Deployment

🐳 Dockerized Deployment
The complete application is containerized using Docker to ensure:
1. Infrastructure consistency
2. Deployment reproducibility
3. Service isolation
4. Simplified deployment workflows

Docker Compose is used to orchestrate:
1. Frontend container
2. API Gateway container
3. Backend microservices
4. MySQL database container
